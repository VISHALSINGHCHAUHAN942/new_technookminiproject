            Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house
            the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz MahalInside the Taj Mahal, the cenotaphs honoring Mumtaz Mahal and
            Shah Jahan are enclosed in an eight-sided chamber ornamented with pietra dura (an inlay with semi-precious

            Shah Jahan as the palace fort of his capital Shahjahanabad, the Red Fort is famous for its massive enclosing
            walls. The fort's construction was completed over a span of ten years, between 1638 and 1648.
            The Red Fort underwent massive destruction in 1739 when the Persian ruler Nadir Shan invaded the city and
            plundered the fort of many valuable artifacts, including the Peacock Throne. Later, during the 1857 Revolt
            against the British, the marble structures of the fort were also destroyed.</p></i>
